Upon the launch of the swap, we will have the following trading pairs available, with more to be added
in the future: 

$PACO-BTCB
$PACO-USDT
$PACO-BUSD

PacoEarn is a mechanism where the fees go into a pool, which is then distributing 1% of the total
allocated amount in the pool to all PACO token holders on a daily basis. The proportion of their earnings
is based on how many PACO tokens the participant is holding/staking on our platform.
